Mike Mason, our Chief AI Officer who previously authored this series, took some time from his busy schedule and is back as a co-author for this piece. He's pairing with Will Amaral, the current Tech Radar product owner, to provide extra insights beyond the current Radar edition.\\nThe AI buzz isn’t slowing down, and “vibe coding” is the new frontier\\nExcitement around AI remains strong, with new AI capabilities and use cases being announced seemingly every week. We previously mentioned the exponential growth of AI-related tools, both for general use and regular software engineering. In the past six to twelve months, AI-powered coding assistants have moved beyond basic autocomplete; modern tools can now handle complex refactoring, understand entire codebases and even execute commands. On the last edition of the Radar we noted the emergence of “agentic” coding assistants — essentially AI programmers that undertake multi-step coding tasks based on high-level prompts — and this trend continues at pace today. Early products like Cursor, Cline and Windsurf lead the way in integrating these features into the IDE and dozens of companies promise an ‘agentic’ software development solution.\\nWhile all of this sounds promising, it's important to note that these tools work in a supervised fashion — the human developer stays “in the loop,” guiding the AI and approving its actions. A recent example is “vibe coding” —\\xa0 a relaxed workflow where developers casually instruct AI through voice or chat prompts. The concept seems appealing due to its speed and casual nature — particularly suitable for quick projects. However, the term quickly went viral, with some companies and startups claiming to exclusively use “vibe coding” for critical production code. This sparked discussions about responsible AI use, reinforcing the necessity of developer judgment and thorough code review in AI-assisted workflows. We remain skeptical of claims of software developers being 100% replaced by AI: our own experiments showed Claude Code saving us 97% of the effort on its first try, then falling flat on its face for the next two attempts.\\nEnterprise intelligence: The AI-ification of the enterprise\\nAI is steadily weaving itself into the fabric of enterprise operations — not just as a tool to automate tasks, but as something that could fundamentally shift how organizations make decisions, manage risk and connect with customers. We’re not all the way there yet, and transformation is still uneven. But more and more companies are starting to see the outlines of a future where AI isn’t a layer on top of the business — it’s baked into its core.\\nThat raises an important question: not whether AI becomes foundational infrastructure, but how we prepare for that without getting caught flat-footed.\\nAs this shift unfolds, quality assurance and governance are becoming more complex and more urgent. Traditional QA practices weren’t built to handle things like model drift, hallucinations or unpredictable behavior. So we’re seeing engineering teams begin to adopt model observability tools, eval frameworks and AI-specific testing practices — especially in industries where the cost of getting it wrong is high.\\nOne of the trickier challenges emerging is what you might call “AI as shadow IT.” Individual teams are spinning up their own tools — sometimes open-source, sometimes SaaS — without going through official channels. It’s easy to see why: these tools are accessible, powerful and often solve real problems. But they also introduce risk — creating a patchwork of AI usage with little oversight or consistency. Some enterprises are starting to respond with lightweight registries, usage tracking and flexible policy frameworks to get ahead of it. It’s still early, but the intent is clear: enable innovation without losing the thread on governance.\\nThere’s also a bigger, less talked-about shift happening: AI is starting to reshape how organizations are designed. This isn’t just about doing more, faster — it’s about changing who does what, how decisions get made, and where accountability sits. Roles are blurring. Assumptions about trust and authority are being tested. And it’s not just a tech issue — it touches leadership, HR and governance, too. Most companies aren’t quite ready for how deep this could go.\\nAt the team level, AI is prompting developers and designers to step back and ask: are we building for humans, or building for machines? As AI tooling gets better — code generation, design suggestions, automation — it’s easy to default to speed. But some teams are pushing back, re-centering on product thinking and UX to make sure what we’re building remains meaningful and sustainable. AI can accelerate delivery, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of clarity or care.\\nThe “AI-ification” of the enterprise isn’t a tidal wave. It’s more like a rising tide — quiet, persistent and shaping everything in its path. The organizations that adapt well won’t just adopt new tools. They’ll ask bigger questions — about structure, capability and trust — and use those answers to steer with intention.\\nObservability keeps complexity in check\\nModern software systems are highly distributed and increasingly infused with AI components, making observability more critical (and more challenging) than ever. This edition of the Radar highlights a wave of innovation in the observability space aimed at keeping up with this complexity. First, as observability becomes increasingly important, much-needed standards gain traction. We saw a great boost in OpenTelemetry's adoption; it’s now one of CNCF’s fastest-growing projects with contributions from over 200 organizations. It fosters a vendor-neutral ecosystem and with the support of tools such as Alloy, Tempo and Loki — allows a wide range of choices and flexibility for developers.\\nAnother driving force behind observability is AI, of course. Observability for AI and LLMs is a focal point with unique challenges. Tracking metrics and logs isn’t enough to detect model drift, prompt failures and hallucinations. In response, new platforms such as Arize Phoenix, Helicone and Humanloop have emerged to trace and evaluate LLM calls. These tools record prompts, track model responses and help diagnose quality issues. As teams operationalize AI, this visibility is vital for trust and reliability — much like APM (application performance monitoring) was vital for microservices.\\nAI's influence on observability is also reciprocated by the integration of AI assistance into observability tools themselves. Given the massive scale of telemetry data (logs, metrics, traces) in cloud applications, operators increasingly rely on AI to detect anomalies and pinpoint issues faster than humans could. Major monitoring platforms now embed machine learning for anomaly detection, alert correlation and root-cause analysis, such as Weights & Biases’ “Weave.”\\nBeyond the AI spotlight\\nIt’s easy to get swept up in the excitement around AI — every week brings a new headline, a new breakthrough, or a bold prediction. But some of the most meaningful progress is happening in what we might call “traditional” software development. AI still hasn’t cracked some of our biggest day-to-day frustrations — like the persistent quirks of cross-platform frameworks. And that’s where we’re seeing familiar tools quietly evolve in powerful ways.\\nTake command-line interfaces (CLIs), for example. Even with the rise of polished GUIs, chat-based tooling, and auto-magic everything, CLI tools are not just sticking around — they're thriving. Developers keep coming back to them for their speed, control, and transparency. And with modern tools like uv and MarkItDown, we’re seeing a fresh generation of CLIs that feel both sophisticated and refreshingly simple. They’re proof that the command line isn’t fading into the background — it’s adapting to stay essential.\\nWe're also seeing some interesting shifts in programming languages. While newer entrants like Gleam are starting to gain traction, others like Swift are expanding their reach well beyond their original ecosystems. Swift, in particular, is carving out a role in resource-constrained environments — an area where performance, reliability, and memory safety matter more than ever. It’s a good reminder that developers are actively seeking out tools that balance modern safety features with real-world efficiency.\\nSolid ground in a shifting landscape\\nWhile AI dominates headlines and tooling — appearing in everything from code assistants to ops platforms — its ubiquity has thrown the spotlight back on the fundamentals: data quality and reliable systems. Without high-quality, well-managed data, even the most powerful AI models falter. And the core of software, ultimately, is still about how we store, manipulate and transform data into value.\\nIn our conversations, a consistent theme emerged: organizations and researchers are rethinking how they manage, serve, and retrieve data. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques are evolving fast, because effective retrieval is the bridge between general-purpose models and organization-specific intelligence. A massive model with outdated or irrelevant context is often less useful than a smaller one with timely, high-quality data. The frontier now includes improving relevance, traceability, and explainability to make RAG more reliable and transparent.\\nBut these advances mean little if the underlying data isn't cared for. Scaling AI and analytics demands a solid data foundation. Increasingly, teams are treating data not as a backend artifact, but as a first-class product — with clear ownership, quality standards, documentation, and a focus on usability. This “data product thinking” draws from concepts like data mesh, where domain teams are responsible for curating and maintaining discoverable, interoperable data assets.\\nIn practice, a data product might be a customer 360 dataset, a risk-scoring pipeline, or an internal dashboard — something designed, versioned, and supported just like any software product. It has customers, provides value, and it evolves over time.\\nThe message is clear: embrace the new, but don’t neglect the foundations. The next era of software won’t be built by AI alone — it will be shaped by teams that combine human creativity, machine intelligence, and strong engineering discipline. That’s where the real leverage lies.\\nDisclaimer: The statements and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the positions of Thoughtworks.\\n\\n Generative AI The machines are rising — but developers still hold the keys Learn more\\n Generative AI Claude Code saved us 97% of the work on the first try.

Agentic AI will handle tasks that once required entire teams. Models with tens of trillions of parameters will decode problems we thought were too messy for machines. Yet the most transformative advances might come from the smallest models: SLMs are already putting AI in places it’s never been. [...] Grok 3's use of chain-of-thought prompting exemplifies how inference time computing can be harnessed effectively. This technique encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, much like a human would when solving a problem. For instance, when tasked with a complex math problem, it doesn’t jump straight to the answer—it breaks the problem into logical chunks, evaluates each step transparently and arrives at a solution

What started as tools that could answer questions or generate images is now developing into systems that plan, adapt and collaborate like never before. Established giants like OpenAI and Google now share the stage with agile newcomers such as China’s DeepSeek—a rising star making waves with fresh approaches to how AI solves problems, proving that groundbreaking ideas can come from anywhere.\\nIn 2025, we’re witnessing more than just smarter algorithms; we’re seeing the arrival of AI systems that learn while they work, autonomous agents that strategize like seasoned professionals and models small enough to fit in your pocket yet powerful enough to compete against supercomputers. These advancements aren’t isolated—they’re converging to create AI that remembers, modifies and collaborates with human-like continuity.\\nPROMOTED\\nBased on my research experience and running an AI company, let’s explore the most important trends poised to reshape AI technologies in 2025.\\n1. AI Agents\\nAn AI agent is a system or program that performs tasks autonomously on behalf of a user or another system using artificial intelligence techniques. Unlike conventional AI, which waits for instructions and simply responds, agentic AI actively figures out what needs to be done and takes action to achieve specific goals. It uses advanced tools like ML (to learn from data), NLP (to understand and use language) and reasoning (to make decisions). This proactive approach allows it to adapt to new situations, learn from what it does and handle complex tasks.\\nIn terms of business operation, an AI agent can autonomously interpret customer requests through NLP, retrieve relevant information and provide personalized responses—all without human intervention. It might even escalate complex issues to human representatives only when necessary, improving efficiency and reducing response times.\\nThe increase in interest in AI agents is also reflected in broader technological and market trends in early 2025. Gartner forecasts that agentic AI will be integrated into 33% of enterprise software applications in 2028, compared to less than 1% in 2024.\\n2. Inference Time Compute\\nInference time compute refers to the computational resources and time required to run a machine learning model to make predictions or inferences on new data. This means allowing the model to spend extra milliseconds (or minutes) “thinking” during real-world use to improve its predictions without requiring retraining.\\nGrok 3\\'s use of chain-of-thought prompting exemplifies how inference time computing can be harnessed effectively. This technique encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps, much like a human would when solving a problem. For instance, when tasked with a complex math problem, it doesn’t jump straight to the answer—it breaks the problem into logical chunks, evaluates each step transparently and arrives at a solution that’s not only accurate but also explainable.\\nCrucially, inference can be tuned and improved without retraining the underlying model. By prioritizing high-quality training data and enhanced inference-time “thought training,” we can create significantly smarter AI agents.\\n3. Very Large Language Models\\nAI developers don’t always publicly disclose precise figures about the parameters of their large language models. However, it’s believed that the current generation of LLMs contains one to two trillion parameters (e.g., 1.8 trillion for GPT 4). The next generation is expected to reach even more parameters. This significant jump promises to unlock even more advanced capabilities, including enhanced reasoning, improved contextual understanding and more fluent and nuanced language generation.\\nStill, bigger isn’t always better—unless you’re training AI to navigate the complexity of human language. While today’s trillion-parameter models demonstrate impressive language processing abilities, such as writing emails or summarizing text, their 2025 successors aim to better understand language and context. A very large language model could, for instance, parse a legal document while referencing regional laws, historical court cases and even cultural biases in legal language.\\n4. Small Language Models\\nNot every AI needs to be a supercomputer. While LLMs have gained much attention, the rise of small language models is equally transformative this year. Smaller models, some with just 3 billion parameters, can punch above their weight. They’re able to achieve comparable performance to their larger counterparts while demanding fewer computational resources. This portability enables SLMs to run on personal devices like laptops and smartphones, democratizing access to powerful AI capabilities, reducing inference times and lowering operational costs.\\nMicrosoft’s Phi-3 represents the most powerful and efficient SLM. This 3.8B smartphone-friendly model handles coding and math problems efficiently. The secret? Better training data. Leveraging high-quality textbooks, code repositories and synthetic exercises, researchers are distilling expertise into compact systems.\\n5. Near Infinite Memory\\nForgetful AI is becoming a challenge. Most of the current generative AI and LLMs have the “memory problem.” They may struggle to recall anything beyond the last few messages and can only effectively parse the most recent prompt, limiting their ability to maintain context in lengthy conversations.\\nThe development of near-infinite memory is set to revolutionize this issue. 2025’s systems can maintain ongoing conversations and recall all previous interactions over months or years. Google Gemini, leveraging this advanced memory capability, can provide highly personalized and context-aware responses by drawing on a user’s entire interaction history. This feature allows it to seamlessly pick up where past conversations left off, adapt to evolving preferences and deliver tailored insights without requiring users to repeat themselves.\\nConclusion\\nAI in 2025 isn’t just a tool—it’s a teammate, a strategist rolled into one. Agentic AI will handle tasks that once required entire teams. Models with tens of trillions of parameters will decode problems we thought were too messy for machines. Yet the most transformative advances might come from the smallest models: SLMs are already putting AI in places it’s never been.\\nBut the real story of 2025 isn’t just about size, speed or even intelligence; it’s about how AI fits into our workflows, devices and the mess of our lives. These trends will blur the lines between human and machine intelligence, unlocking productivity and creativity.\\n\\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

In the healthcare sector, Google’s new AI-powered medical imaging tool, AMIE, can analyze X-rays and MRIs, helping doctors quickly detect abnormalities and improve patient outcomes. These innovations reflect the broader shift toward AI-driven innovation in both tech and healthcare.\\nAI in Journalism and Media: Augmenting Creativity\\nThe AI revolution isn’t confined to tech giants—media and journalism are also undergoing significant change. In 2025, AI in journalism is primarily being used to enhance content creation, supporting reporters and editors with research, drafting, and fact-checking. However, AI hasn’t yet replaced the need for human creativity, judgment, and ethical decision-making in news reporting. This hybrid model, where AI-powered journalism tools augment professionals rather than replace them, is setting the standard for creative industries in this new era of artificial intelligence.\\nAI in Manufacturing: Transforming Industry Operations\\nRecent research highlights a rapid rise in AI adoption in manufacturing industry processes during 2025. Manufacturers are using artificial intelligence for everything from supply chain optimization to quality control and predictive maintenance. This AI technology is resulting in more efficient operations, reduced costs, and improved product quality—a true game-changer for industrial transformation.Surprisingly, some economic analysts believe the tariff-induced slowdown expected in 2025 could actually accelerate the American AI revolution, fostering innovation, expanding the middle class, and breathing new life into US manufacturing.\\nEthical and Legal Challenges: AI and Copyright in 2025\\nThe fast pace of AI industry developments is not without controversy. In the UK, the music industry has raised concerns about government decisions allowing AI training on copyrighted works. As AI copyright issues mount, stakeholders question how to balance technological progress with the protection of intellectual property. This debate will be critical as the value of creative work and rights of artists are challenged by the ever-expanding capabilities of artificial intelligence.\\nCollaborative Innovation: AI, Business Intelligence, and Beyond\\nCross-industry collaboration is driving some of the most promising advances in the AI sector. Conferences like Strategy World 2025 in Orlando are showcasing how AI merges with business intelligence and even blockchain technologies like Bitcoin. As AI systems become more sophisticated, collaborative trends in the AI industry are expected to produce groundbreaking applications and business models.\\nThe Future of AI in 2025\\nThe AI industry in 2025 is entering a new phase of maturity—not as a replacement for human intelligence, but as a platform to amplify human creativity and innovation. Expect to see the next wave of AI technology updates balancing efficiency and automation with ethical considerations and respect for intellectual property. Stay tuned for more latest AI news as this technological revolution continues to reshape every aspect of our lives.\\n\\n\\nWant to try it yourself?

Find out with the sharpest takes to come out of Think 2025.\\nData at 230 mph: The race to unlock enterprise AI\\n10:30 a.m. EDT | May 6, 2025\\nHave you ever seen a fuel-injected data processing machine that can travel at 230 mph? If you’re on-site at IBM Think, head to the demo floor to see the Scuderia Ferrari HP Formula 1 race car. With sensors that detect sense heat, pressure, friction and fuel, this machine generates more than one million data points per second. It also explains why IBM’s Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna invited Scuderia Ferrrari HP\\'s team principal, Frédéric Vasseur, onstage this morning during his keynote kicking off Think 2025.\\n“AI is the productivity engine,” Krishna explained. “AI unlocks the value in your data.”\\xa0In this case, IBM watsonx is using generative AI to transform the torrent of track data that Scuderia Ferrari HP collects into a new, more personalized and interactive\\xa0mobile experience\\xa0for passionate global Ferrari fans. This, in turn, helps Ferrari (and its partners) increase engagement with its core customers.\\nThose\\xa0core customers or fans are\\xa0shifting\\xa0gears, too. “It’s not just the historic fans anymore,” Vasseur said. New fans are “more focused on the name of the driver’s girlfriend than lap times.”\\xa0That core fan base has tripled\\xa0in the past five years and now counts more than 390 million followers around the world.

HashiCorp Co-Founder and CTO\\xa0Armon Dadgar\\xa0described a\\xa0situation that\\xa0thousands of enterprises face: disconnected app teams, scattered systems and growing inefficiency. “What we see day in and day out is gaps,” he said.\\xa0But closing them is possible, he insisted, by\\xa0standardizing workflows and building unified platforms that support the whole application and infrastructure lifecycle.\\nDeutsche Telekom\\xa0is already seeing measurable results from such\\xa0automation. The company cut patching time by 80 percent, allowing teams to manage growing security threats without overwhelming their operations. “It’s maybe not the sexy stuff that you read about,” said CIO\\xa0Peter Leukert, “but it’s the core of our duties that we need to do well.”\\nWatch the full keynote here\\nIBM’s\\xa0Madhu Kochar, Vice President of Automation,\\xa0emphasized that\\xa0most tech stacks\\xa0were\\xa0not\\xa0designed to scale\\xa0for the future AI is creating. “Hybrid environments are more complex than ever, and gen AI is adding to it,” she said.\\xa0To clarify the complexity\\xa0of a business\\'s\\xa0APIs, apps, integration endpoints, data and events, IBM offers\\xa0its\\xa0webMethods Hybrid Integration\\xa0platform,\\xa0giving\\xa0organizations unified control and real-time visibility across environments.\\nKochar stressed that businesses need to shift toward agentic automation and AI-driven orchestration, adding that “rigid, static integrations won\\'t work.”\\xa0By adopting these methods,\\xa0enterprises can reduce\\xa0months of work\\xa0to hours.\\nCloud adoption may be widespread, but results remain uneven. “ROI is a little less certain, 20% or so,”\\xa0Thomas said.\\xa0The missing ingredient, he said, is hybrid infrastructure—an architecture that connects public cloud, private systems and on-premise\\xa0environments into a cohesive, orchestrated whole.\\nLooking ahead, the experts emphasized that the landscape is poised for rapid growth.\\xa0“Over the next three years, 1 billion applications will be built on the basis of generative AI,” Thomas said. “They will need to be able to work with each other seamlessly.”\\nPepsi and Slack share how they tackle AI\\'s next hurdle: Agent sprawl\\n5 p.m. EDT\\xa0| May 6, 2025\\nWith agents come opportunities. Take Pepsi: the company is already working on more than 1,500 bots, assistants and agents—stats shared by\\xa0Magesh Bagavathi,\\xa0an\\xa0SVP\\xa0and\\xa0Global Head of Data, Analytics\\xa0and AI at PepsiCo, during a keynote at Think 2025.\\n“These bots are all starting to expand at scale,\\xa0and it’s all coming together because we’ve got a very platform-centric approach,” he\\xa0continued. That means with agentic AI, PepsiCo can save thousands of hours across its value chain.\\nBy deploying\\xa0agents, interacting with\\xa0enterprise systems will no longer require specialized skills or knowledge. “The next big step change is systems of intelligence powered by AI agents,” said Ritika Gunnar,\\xa0a\\xa0General Manager\\xa0of\\xa0Data\\xa0and\\xa0AI\\xa0at IBM. “They\\'re doers. They don’t just report insights. They act autonomously, orchestrating workflows across your enterprise. This is putting AI to work for business.”\\nWatch the full keynote here\\nThis comes with a caveat, she cautioned: “Now, the explosion of AI agents across the enterprise holds immense promise.\\xa0But let’s be real for a minute: it also creates significant complexity.”\\nA major culprit? Businesses are deploying agents in silos, and they’re not always well-integrated into existing tools and applications. This was the catalyst behind the update to\\xa0IBM watsonx Orchestrate, which offers\\xa0agent orchestration\\xa0to handle the multi-agent, multi-tool coordination needed to tackle complex projects across vendors. “Building powerful agents is just the start,” Gunnar said. “The real magic happens when they connect.”\\nPeter Doolan, Chief Consumer Officer at Slack, believes agentic platforms will unlock unprecedented levels of growth for companies. He cites the example of one of Slack’s customers,\\xa0Adecco,\\xa0a human resources provider and temporary staffing firm that receives 300 million applicants every year.\\n“There\\'s no way that Adecco is able to have enough humans to be able to read and parse through all those 300 million applications,” Doolan said. “And so this is a perfect example of where digital labor has the ability to supercharge a company while [helping] people refocus on what their superpower is, which is understanding the perfect job for you and the perfect time to have that job.”\\nAnd that’s a reason to be optimistic, said Doolan. “There’s an extraordinary optimism about the future, about how we can take this untapped value and release it across all of our workforces.”\\nBNP Paribas shows how to unlock fragmented data for enterprise AI\\n9:30 a.m. EDT\\xa0| May 7, 2025\\nEnterprise data has taken center stage at Think\\xa02025—particularly the fact that less than 1% of it currently fuels the massive language models that dominate\\xa0AI headlines.\\n“Data is your true differentiator,” said\\xa0Matt Hicks, CEO of Red Hat,\\xa0in an energetic keynote conversation this morning with\\xa0Ric Lewis, IBM’s SVP of Infrastructure. Inside that data is everything that makes a business unique: its customer relationships, operational history and institutional know-how.\\nBut that data is typically scattered—across on-prem systems, public and private clouds,\\xa0and edge environments—creating a hybrid setup almost by default. “To make AI effective, we need to bring AI to all those locations where you have data, where you have applications, where you have customers,” said\\xa0Hillery Hunter,\\xa0CTO and GM of Innovation for IBM Infrastructure. “Including\\xa0[at]\\xa0the heart of your mission-critical enterprise.”\\nOne approach gaining traction is hybrid by design: a strategy that integrates data and systems across environments from the outset, rather than layering them together after the fact. IBM and its subsidiary Red Hat are leaning on this model as\\xa0a\\xa0central pillar of enterprise readiness for AI. With this strategy, enterprises are managing and monitoring the full lifecycle of AI models—both predictive and generative—across environments ranging from single servers to distributed systems.\\nWatch the full keynote\\nWhile designing such systems from the get-go is the optimal approach, connecting legacy architecture to get better access to\\xa0scattered, siloed\\xa0data is entirely possible—and essential\\xa0to\\xa0unlock the value of a company\\'s proprietary data. In fact, IBM works with many companies to do just that, including\\xa0BNP Paribas.\\nBNP Paribas Group CTO\\xa0Jean-Michel Garcia\\xa0joined Hunter on stage to describe how the bank has applied such a hybrid-by-design model, working with both IBM and Red Hat. The approach has supported the company’s efforts to extract value from its data across diverse environments while meeting regulatory and security requirements.\\nThis strategy is the result of a partnership that has been in place for seven years, but a\\xa0newly signed 10-year extension\\xa0will propel the band into a new phase—building what Garcia calls an “AI Factory.” This will be a purpose-built infrastructure that includes hardware, software and workflows for developing, training and deploying AI at scale. And it’s possible, he continues, “as a result of having a strong hybridization, plus a strong containerization platform, plus the right data management model.”\\nAs companies move from the\\xa0“promise of AI to the profit of AI” as Hunter put it, “doing AI fast but carefully” will need to be top of mind, said Garcia. “I like to call it AI with seatbelts,” Hunter added.\\nLockheed and Meta show: There’s more than one way to build together\\n12:30 p.m. EDT\\xa0| May 7, 2025\\nWhen Meta released its first open Llama model two years ago, many questioned the wisdom of spending billions to develop models that would be shared for free. Some doubted that it was even possible for the company to develop high-performing open-source models for the broader community while also developing models for its own products. Still, Meta bet that going open would speed up innovation.\\nThat bet appears be paying off. In a keynote conversation with Dinesh Nirmal, SVP for Software Products at IBM, Ash Jhaveri, VP of Reality Labs and AI Partnerships at Meta, shared that the company has now seen 1.2 billion downloads of its Llama model series. “The beauty of open is that the community becomes a force multiplier,” said Jhaveri. Then developers wanted a framework, so Meta also created a modular framework called the\\xa0Llama Stack, “a modular toolbox that you can plug in things like agents, post training, evals, and they all snap together like Lego pieces,” he explained.\\nThat modular design makes Meta’s Llama Stack a natural fit for IBM, which shares the core belief that the AI community works better when it works together. Now, watsonx is\\xa0integrated as an API provider\\xa0within the Llama Stack, enabling enterprises to deploy generative AI at scale, with openness at the core.\\nWatch the full keynote\\nBut not every industry can go fully open. As Nirmal noted, sectors like defense, security and healthcare face different constraints, including the need for strict compliance, regulatory oversight and risk thresholds. Enter Richard Vitek, Vice President of Data, Analytics and AI Enablement at Lockheed Martin. “We want to be able to take advantage of all those open tools [and] get the benefit of all that knowledge,” he said, “but not expose any security risk.”\\nThat push-pull dynamic—open innovation versus closed-system safety—is one IBM is helping enterprises navigate. It starts by baking governance and security into the earliest stages of preparing enterprise data for AI tools, said Nirmal. Using the\\xa0watsonx.data platform, for example, companies can ensure that proprietary data is governed as it’s ingested and stored, making it secure from the start. The best part, he added, is “the\\xa0watsonx.data\\xa0platform can now prepare AI-ready data for enterprises in under five minutes.”\\nWhile the keynote was focused on data, it also underscored something broader: the strength of the industry ecosystem. “To me, the future isn\\'t just about open versus closed,” said Jhaveri, “It\\'s really about who you\\'re building with.”\\nBalancing the now and the next: Data, agents and the new workforce\\n2:30 p.m. EDT\\xa0| May 7, 2025\\nToday’s enterprise leaders are no stranger to reconciling short-term demands with long-term innovation—and the stakes are high.\\xa0“CEOs are facing the competing pressures of funding existing operations and investing in innovation,” said Mohamad Ali, Senior Vice President at IBM Consulting, during his keynote at Think 2025.\\nQuoting a new study from the\\xa0IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV), which surveyed 2,000 leaders, Ali noted that CEOs are not only embracing AI—they’re actively adopting AI agents and preparing to implement them at scale.\\nWhere leadership is tested most, Ali said, is balancing the pressure to show quarterly results, reduce costs and keep core operations running smoothly with the need to invest in next-generation tools, data architecture and workforce upskilling.\\nStriking that balance between efficiency and innovation takes more than vision. And companies like Heineken and Cencora are building the technical foundations required to turn AI ambition into results.\\nWatch the full keynote\\nTo advance its digital transformation, Heineken, one of the most iconic beer brands in the world, is overhauling its data stack to accelerate AI-driven value delivery. Ronald den Elzen, Chief Digital and Technology Officer at The Heineken Company, acknowledged from the stage that the company still has a ”massive amount of work to do [in order to] build a secure and resilient digital backup.”\\nPawan Verma, Executive Vice President and Chief Data and Information Officer at the pharmaceutical company Cencora, underscored that idea. “You need reliable data—in particular, data that can propagate,” he said. “You combine that with a culture that looks at [the data] every day, because in our industry, what is most critical is reliability and accuracy.”\\nFor both companies, scalable and trustworthy AI starts with strong, enterprise-wide data infrastructure. But infrastructure alone isn’t enough. AI needs to be integrated into workflows in ways that support human talent, not replace it.\\nIBM has been its own “client zero” in embedding AI into real operations. In HR, for example, the company has automated one million tasks, and now resolves 95% of employee requests—across 11.5 million interactions—\\xa0without escalation.\\n“It’s an astonishing number,”\\xa0said Neil Dhar, a Global Managing Partner at IBM Consulting. “What does that do? It creates a world-class HR function that’s able to flex across the entire organization. We can empower our people, allow them to do what they need to do.”\\nMeanwhile, agentic AI is now becoming an “intelligent layer” across vast systems, helping teams resolve issues quickly and integrate data seamlessly. That’s the idea behind\\xa0IBM’s partnership with Oracle, which brings watsonx into the workflow.\\n“This truly is an innovative time in our lives, where there is really an opportunity where everyone needs to think about AI agents in the workflow,”\\xa0said Laura-Elizabeth Ware,\\xa0a\\xa0Senior VP\\xa0of\\xa0North America HCM Cloud Applications\\xa0at Oracle.\\xa0“But even before you get started—in the area of HR—you really need to look at skills, and defining your skills strategy.”\\nThat workforce focus is timely. The IBV CEO Study found that more than a third of leaders expect to retrain and reskill their teams, and half anticipate hiring for roles that didn’t exist a year ago. That means that a clear skills inventory is critical, and understanding where agents fit into real workflows and skillsets is emerging as a new frontier of enterprise readiness.\\nIBM says goodbye to prompts, hello to programming for AI\\n5:30 p.m. EDT\\xa0| May 7, 2025\\nIs IBM trying to kill the prompt?\\nIt sure looked that way as the\\xa0company introduced\\xa0a new concept for “generative computing” during its final\\xa0keynote\\xa0of Think 2025. Generative computing replaces\\xa0prompt engineering\\xa0with structured programming for large language models\\xa0(LLMs)—and is\\xa0part of a broader push to fuse artificial intelligence, classical high-performance computing and quantum systems into a unified model for enterprise IT. The focus is on immediate, real-world utility, rather than distant speculation.\\n“These are not dreams anymore,” said\\xa0Zaira Nazario,\\xa0Director of Science and Technology at IBM. “We\\'re already connecting\\xa0HPC\\xa0and quantum systems to enable quantum-centric supercomputing.”\\nIBM\\xa0experts\\xa0say\\xa0prompting has become an untenable method for building complex AI systems.\\xa0Sriram Raghavan,\\xa0a VP\\xa0of\\xa0IBM\\xa0Research\\xa0for AI, argued that prompt-based interactions are too brittle and model-specific to scale.\\n“Very soon, we\\'re going to have books and books of prompts,” he said, calling much of the current practice “security by prayer.”\\nGenerative computing, by contrast, allows developers to build AI applications through\\xa0a\\xa0runtime\\xa0that enforces clear rules, constraints and behaviors. In testing, IBM’s new framework achieved comparable accuracy to 70-billion-parameter models using systems with only one billion parameters.\\nIBM’s generative computing approach brings software engineering principles to AI by letting developers define behavior through modular components,\\xa0instead of\\xa0natural language. The runtime supports features like multi-step generation, strict formatting rules and model-specific routing—all handled programmatically. This means developers can build applications without rewriting code every time the underlying model changes. The result, Raghavan said,\\xa0is faster development, better security and more reliable performance across models of different sizes and capabilities.\\nWatch the full keynote\\nQuantum utility\\nAlongside its work in AI, IBM has advanced the frontier of quantum computing, reaching what it calls a new phase of technical capability.\\xa0Jay Gambetta,\\xa0IBM Fellow and Vice President of IBM Quantum, said the\\xa0company\\xa0has reached\\xa0quantum utility, meaning its quantum computers can now solve problems that classical systems cannot simulate.\\nHe\\xa0described\\xa0experiments\\xa0pairing a 45-qubit processor with Japan’s\\xa0Fugaku supercomputer\\xa0to simulate complex molecules,\\xa0with results that match the best classical methods. A 77-qubit follow-up showed similar promise.\\xa0Gambetta said that the\\xa0company expects to demonstrate\\xa0quantum advantage\\xa0by 2026, a milestone where quantum systems outperform classical computers on meaningful, real-world problems with verified accuracy.\\nMarking the\\xa0100-year anniversary\\xa0of quantum mechanics, Gambetta noted that IBM’s foundational work, from pioneering quantum hardware to launching the first cloud-accessible quantum computer, positioned it to lead this new era.\\n“We\\'re not interested in demos,” Gambetta said. “We\\'re building systems that actually work.”\\nMore announcements from Think 2025\\nThe future of application resource management with IBM Turbonomic\\nIBM is unveiling groundbreaking advancements within IBM Turbonomic, designed to help organizations enhance their application performance and efficiency posture.\\xa0IBM Turbonomic now integrates with GitHub and HashiCorp Terraform, enabling cloud-based application workloads defined as code to be safely optimized.

But we will incorporate the latest research whenever possible. Randy has just completed his annual survey of data, analytics, and AI executives, the 2025 AI & Data Leadership Executive Benchmark Survey, conducted by his educational firm, Data & AI Leadership Exchange; and Tom has worked on several surveys on generative AI and data, technology leadership structures, and, most recently, agentic AI.\\nHere are the 2025 AI trends on our radar screens that leaders should understand and monitor.\\n1. Leaders will grapple with both the promise and hype around agentic AI.\\nLet’s get agentic AI — the kind of AI that does tasks independently — out of the way first: It’s a sure bet for 2025’s “most trending AI trend.” Agentic AI seems to be on an inevitable rise: Everybody in the tech vendor and analyst worlds is excited about the prospect of having AI programs collaborate to do real work instead of just generating content, even though nobody is entirely sure how it will all work. Some IT leaders think they already have it (37%, in a forthcoming UiPath-sponsored survey of 252 U.S. IT leaders); most expect it soon and are ready to spend money on it (68% within six months or less); and a few skeptics (primarily encountered by us in interviews) think it’s mostly vendor hype.\\nMost technology executives believe that these autonomous and collaborative AI programs will be primarily based on focused generative AI bots that will perform specific tasks. Most people believe that there will be a network of these agents, and many are hoping that the agent ecosystems will need less human intervention than AI has required in the past. Some believe that the technology will all be orchestrated by robotic process automation tools; some propose that agents will be fetched by enterprise transaction systems; and some posit the emergence of an “uber agent” that will control everything.\\nThe earliest agentic AI tools will be those for small, structured internal tasks with little money involved.\\nHere’s what we think: There will be (and in some cases, already are) generative AI bots that will do people’s bidding on specific content creation tasks. It will require more than one of these agentic AI tools to do something significant, such as make a travel reservation or conduct a banking transaction. But these systems still work by predicting the next word, and sometimes that will lead to errors or inaccuracies. So there will still be a need for humans to check in on them every now and then.\\nThe earliest agents will be those for small, structured internal tasks with little money involved — for instance, helping change your password on the IT side, or reserving time off for vacations in HR systems. We don’t see much likelihood of companies turning these agents loose on real customers spending real money anytime soon, unless there’s the opportunity for human review or the reversal of a transaction. As a result, we don’t foresee a major impact on the human workforce from this technology in 2025, except for new jobs writing blog posts about agentic AI. (Wait, can agents do that?)\\n2. The time has come to measure results from generative AI experiments.\\nOne of the reasons why everybody is excited about agents is that as of 2024, it has still proved difficult to demonstrate economic value from generative AI. We argued in last year’s AI trends article that the value of GenAI still needed to be demonstrated. Data and AI leaders in Randy’s 2025 AI & Data Leadership Executive Benchmark Survey said they are confident that GenAI value is being generated: Fifty-eight percent said that their organization has achieved exponential productivity or efficiency gains from AI, presumably mostly from generative AI. Another 16% said that they have “liberated knowledge workers from mundane tasks” through the use of GenAI tools. Let’s hope that these highly positive beliefs are correct.\\nBut companies shouldn’t take such confidence on faith. Very few companies are actually measuring productivity gains carefully or figuring out what the liberated knowledge workers are doing with their freed-up time. Only a few academic studies have measured GenAI productivity gains, and when they have, they’ve generally found some improvements, but not exponential ones. Goldman Sachs is one of the rare companies that has measured productivity gains in the area of programming. Developers there reported that their productivity increased by about 20%. Most similar studies have found contingent factors in productivity, where either inexperienced workers gain more (as in customer service and consulting) or experienced workers do better (as in code generation).\\nIn many cases, the best way to measure productivity gains will be to establish controlled experiments. For example, a company could have one group of marketers use generative AI to create content without human review, one use it with human review, and a control group not use it at all. Again, few companies are doing this, and this will need to change. Given that GenAI is primarily about content generation for many companies right now, if we want to really understand the benefits, we’ll also have to start measuring content quality. That’s notoriously difficult to do with knowledge work output. However, if GenAI helps write blog posts much faster but the posts are boring and inaccurate, that’s important to measure: There will be little benefit in that particular use case.\\nThe sad fact is that if many organizations are actually to achieve exponential productivity gains, those improvements may be measured in large-scale layoffs. But there is no sign of mass layoffs in the employment statistics. Additionally, a Nobel Prize winner in economics this year, MIT’s Daron Acemoglu, has commented that we haven’t seen real productivity gains from AI thus far, and he doesn’t expect to see anything dramatic over the next several years — perhaps a 0.5% increase over the next decade. In any case, if companies are really going to see and profit from GenAI, they’re going to need to measure and experiment to see the benefits.\\n3. Reality about data-driven culture sets in.\\nWe seem to be realizing that generative AI is very cool but doesn’t change everything, specifically long-term cultural attributes. In our trend article last year, we noted that Randy’s survey found that the percentage of company respondents who said that their organization had “created a data and AI-driven organization” and “established a data and AI-driven organizational culture” both doubled over the prior year (from 24% to 48% for creating data- and AI-driven organizations, and from 21% to 43% for establishing data-driven cultures). We were both somewhat astonished at this dramatic reported improvement, and we attributed the changes to generative AI, since it was very widely publicized and adopted rapidly by organizations.\\nOur long-term prediction is that generative AI alone is not enough to make organizations and cultures data-driven.\\nThis year, the numbers have settled back to Earth a bit. Thirty-seven percent of those surveyed said they work in a data- and AI-driven organization, and 33% said they have a data- and AI-driven culture. It’s still a good thing that data and AI leaders feel that their organizations have improved in this regard over the distant past, but our long-term prediction is that generative AI alone is not enough to make organizations and cultures data-driven.\\nIn the same survey, 92% of the respondents said they feel that cultural and change management challenges are the primary barrier to becoming data- and AI-driven. This suggests that any technology alone is insufficient. It’s worth noting that most of the surveyed employees were from legacy organizations that were founded over a generation ago and have a history of transforming gradually. Many of these companies did more to execute on their digital strategies during the pandemic than they had in the previous two decades.\\n4. Unstructured data is important again.\\nGenerative AI has had another impact on organizations: It’s making unstructured data important again. In the 2025 AI & Data Leadership Executive Benchmark Survey, 94% of data and AI leaders said that interest in AI is leading to a greater focus on data. Since traditional analytical AI has been around for several decades, we think they were referring to GenAI’s impact. In another survey that we mentioned in last year’s AI trends article, there was substantial evidence that most companies hadn’t yet started to really manage data to get ready for generative AI.\\nThe great majority of the data that GenAI works with is relatively unstructured, in forms such as text, images, video, and the like. A leader at one large insurance organization recently shared with Randy that 97% of the company’s data was unstructured. Many companies are interested in using GenAI to help manage and provide access to their own data and documents, typically using an approach called retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. But some companies haven’t worked on their unstructured data much since the days of knowledge management 20 or more years ago. They’ve been focused on structured data — typically rows and columns of numbers from transactional systems.\\nTo get unstructured data into shape, organizations need to pick the best examples of each document type, tag or graph the content, and get it loaded into the system. (Welcome to the arcane world of embeddings, vector databases, and similarity search algorithms.) These approaches do provide considerable knowledge-access benefits for employees, which is why many organizations are pursuing them. But this work is still human-intensive. At some point, perhaps, we’ll be able to just load tons of our internal documents into a GenAI prompt window, but 2025 is unlikely to be that time. Even when that’s possible, there will still be a need for considerable human curation of the data — because ChatGPT can’t tell which is the best of 20 different sales proposals.\\nRelated Articles\\n TurboTax Meets Turbo Innovation: AI at Intuit | Thomas H.

Expect continued struggle.\\nIt should perhaps come as no surprise that while data and attempts to exploit it with AI are receiving increasing amounts of organizational attention and investment, the data leadership function itself is continuing to struggle. The role is still relatively nascent — just 12% of organizations in Randy’s first annual executive survey back in 2012 had appointed a chief data officer. Progress is being made: Eighty-five percent of organizations in Randy’s newest survey have named a chief data officer, and increasing percentages of those data leaders are primarily focused on growth, innovation, and transformation (as opposed to avoiding risk or regulatory problems). More organizations have also named chief AI officers — a surprising 33%.\\nWhile these roles continue to evolve, organizations continue to wrestle with their mandates, responsibilities, and reporting structures. Fewer than half of data leaders (mostly chief data officers) who responded to Randy’s AI & Data Leadership Executive Benchmark Survey said their function is very successful and well established, and only 51% said they feel that the job is well understood within their organizations. We are still not sure that the responsibilities of a chief AI officer and a chief data (and analytics/AI) officer demand separate roles, though some organizations, including Capital One and Cleveland Clinic, have established the chief AI officer role as a peer to the chief data officer.\\nThe one thing that we can say with confidence is that the demand for data and AI leadership will only grow, under whatever shape, form, and structure this demand entails.\\nWe’re of two minds about the broader future of the chief data and AI officer. Randy firmly believes that the role of CDAO should be a business role reporting into business leadership. He notes that 36% of data and AI leaders in his survey this year reported to either the CEO, president, or COO. Randy strongly believes that data and AI leaders need to deliver measurable business value, and to understand and speak the language of the business.\\nTom agrees that tech leaders need to be more focused on business value. But as we argued in last year’s trend report, he feels that there are too many “tech chiefs,” including CDAOs, in most organizations. Many of those CDAOs themselves feel that their internal customers are confused by all of the C-level tech executives and that the proliferation of such roles makes it both difficult to collaborate and unlikely that they will report to the CEO. Tom would prefer to see “supertech leaders,” with all of the tech roles reporting to them, as is the case in a growing number of companies that have promoted transformation-minded CIOs to fill the role. Whatever the right answer is, it’s clear that organizations must make some interventions and make those who lead data as respected as the data itself.\\nIn this short follow-up video,\\xa0MIT SMR AI experts Thomas H.

New speech-to-text and text-to-speech models were added to the OpenAI API, offering improved transcription accuracy and more expressive, natural voice generation (This week’s AI industry updates: March 25, 2025). These upgrades enable developers to build more realistic voice assistants and AI agents. (OpenAI’s ChatGPT service itself saw continued tweaks, though the headline change was the integration of these advanced voice capabilities into the ecosystem.)\\nGoogle – Search and Assistant Upgrades: Google rolled out generative AI enhancements across its user platforms. In Search, Google introduced an “AI mode” and broadened access to AI Overviews (AI-generated summaries in search results) (Expanding AI Overviews and introducing AI Mode). These features help users get direct answers and topic summaries, reflecting Google’s ongoing effort to infuse AI into search experience. Additionally, Google announced a strategic shift for its virtual assistant: the company plans to replace Google Assistant with a Gemini AI chatbot by the end of 2025. This means millions of users will transition from the classic Assistant to a more advanced Gemini-powered conversational agent (with Google promising more powerful capabilities, albeit some existing features may be retired).\\nMicrosoft – 365 Copilot Enhancements: Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilot (integrated into Windows 11 and the Office 365 suite) received notable updates. In March, Microsoft enabled image analysis in Copilot chat, allowing users to upload images and have the AI generate insights or captions (What’s New In Copilot | March 2025 – Changing Social). The Microsoft 365 Copilot also became available on more platforms (including a new MacOS app (Release Notes: March 5th, 2025 | Microsoft Copilot Blog), as Microsoft continues expanding its “AI assistant” across its products. These enhancements are aimed at making Copilot more useful for everyday productivity – from understanding diagrams in documents to acting as a creative assistant in Outlook, Teams, and beyond.\\nxAI – Grok 3 API Launch: On April 9, 2025, xAI launched an API for its flagship model, Grok 3, marking a significant step in its AI strategy. Grok 3, which powers features on Elon Musk’s social network X, offers reasoning capabilities and excels in tasks like image analysis and interactive question answering. The Grok 3 API is available in two versions: Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini, with the former priced at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, while the smaller model is more affordable, at $0.30 per million input tokens and $0.50 per million output tokens. The API also provides speedier versions of both models for a premium rate, designed for users needing higher performance for their applications. Despite its high cost, Grok 3 aims to compete with other top models in the market, including Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, though it is priced higher than Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which has outperformed Grok 3 in various benchmarks. Grok 3 is marketed as a more unfiltered AI, with Musk positioning it as a tool for bold and controversial answers. However, it is still unclear whether Grok 3 has successfully met Musk’s goal of political neutrality in its responses. The API currently supports a 131,072 token context window, shorter than initially promised, and is available for developers to integrate into their applications. (Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, launches an API for Grok 3)\\nAnthropic – Claude Service Tiers: (Corporate update within product context) Anthropic introduced a new Claude “Max” subscription plan for its Claude AI assistant. Aimed at power-users and enterprises, the Max plan (priced up to $200/month) offers 20× higher usage limits and priority access to Anthropic’s latest models (Anthropic Debuts $200-per-Month Subscription to Claude AI Model) (Anthropic Debuts $200-per-Month Subscription to Claude AI Model). This move, coming in early April, mirrors OpenAI’s strategy of offering premium tiers (like ChatGPT Pro) and shows the demand for greater AI usage at the high end. It also highlights how AI companies are monetizing their services by catering to both casual users and heavy workloads.\\n\\nNotable AI Hardware Announcements\\n\\nNVIDIA – Next-Gen GPUs and “AI Factory” Platform: Nvidia used its GTC 2025 conference (late March) to launch a suite of new AI hardware. Foremost was the unveiling of its Blackwell GPU architecture via the Nvidia Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform. This next-gen platform delivers roughly 1.5× the AI performance of the current flagship (H100) and is built for the coming “age of AI reasoning,” where greater compute is needed for more advanced AI agents. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that Blackwell-based systems can efficiently handle the full AI workflow – from training to inference – and will enable the creation of “AI factories” (advanced data centers optimized for AI). Nvidia also teased its future “Vera” CPU and “Rubin” GPU combo (the successor to the current Grace+Blackwell chips), which will feature massive memory upgrades (4× memory capacity and 2.4× bandwidth of the previous gen) to support ever-larger models (Nvidia GTC 2025: Four big announcements you need to know about | IT Pro).\\nNVIDIA – AI Model Releases and Robotics: In a surprising expansion beyond hardware, Nvidia launched its own AI models to support developers. Dubbed Llama Nemotron, this is a family of open “reasoning” models built on Meta’s LLaMA, but refined by Nvidia for improved logic, math, and coding tasks. Nvidia claims these models are up to 20% more accurate on complex reasoning than the base LLaMA, and run 5× faster inference due to optimizations. Major partners like Microsoft’s Azure AI and SAP are already integrating Llama Nemotron models to power AI agent features in their platforms. In the robotics arena, Nvidia introduced Isaac GR00T N1, touted as the world’s first open-source humanoid robot foundation model. This AI model (actually a set of models) is pre-trained by Nvidia to help robots perform human-like tasks (e.g. grasping and moving objects with arms) and is meant to accelerate development of “generalist” robots. The robotics community buzzed as Nvidia demonstrated a humanoid robot using this model to do household chores, underscoring the growing convergence of AI and robotics (Nvidia GTC 2025: Four big announcements you need to know about | IT Pro).\\nIntel – Gaudi 3 Accelerators on Cloud: Chipmaker Intel made strides in challenging NVIDIA’s dominance by pushing its Gaudi 3 AI accelerators into mainstream availability. In early April, IBM Cloud announced it has deployed Intel Gaudi 3 chips in its data centers (Frankfurt and Washington, D.C.), making them accessible to customers for AI workloads. Gaudi 3 is Intel’s 5nm AI chip (from its Habana Labs acquisition) that boasts 2× the FP8 compute and 1.5× memory bandwidth of its Gaudi 2 predecessor. Notably, Intel claims Gaudi 3 offers up to 50% better inference performance on popular models (like Meta’s LLaMA-2 and OpenAI’s GPT-3) at a fraction of the cost of Nvidia’s H100 GPU. By partnering with IBM Cloud, Intel is providing enterprises a cloud-based option to train and run AI models on Gaudi hardware, potentially increasing competition in the AI chip market and giving cost-conscious AI developers more choice (Intel’s Gaudi 3 AI chips now available on IBM Cloud – DCD).\\nBroadcom – AI Networking Chips: To support the exploding scale of AI, Broadcom (known for networking and semiconductors) introduced new networking chips optimized for AI data centers. These chips are designed to handle the high-bandwidth data flows required by large-scale AI training while being power-efficient. As AI models and clusters grow, fast interconnects (network switches, NICs, etc.) are critical bottlenecks. Broadcom’s solution aims to improve data throughput between thousands of GPUs/accelerators, thus enabling better scalability (and lower energy use) in AI supercomputers (Latest AI Breakthroughs and News: March 2025 | News). Industry analysts note that such networking advancements are vital to prevent communication lag when training giant models – essentially complementing the GPU announcements by companies like Nvidia.\\nCerebras – AI Supercomputing Centers: AI hardware startup Cerebras Systems announced an ambitious expansion of its AI cloud infrastructure. Cerebras, famous for its wafer-scale AI chips (the largest chips ever built), is launching six new AI datacenters across North America and Europe dedicated to running AI inference workloads (News – Cerebras). Slated to come online starting mid-2025, these centers will host Cerebras’s CS-2 systems to deliver ultra-high throughput for AI models, reportedly offering 10× faster inference at 7× lower cost than traditional GPU-based setups (Cerebras Unveils Six Data Centers to Meet Accelerating Demand for …). This move positions Cerebras as a challenger to Nvidia in the cloud inference market. By providing access to its hardware via the cloud, Cerebras lowers the barrier for companies to experiment with large-scale AI on non-Nvidia architecture. The announcement underscores how startups are pushing innovative hardware (like wafer-scale chips) and even building entire cloud services around them to meet the surging demand for AI computation.\\n\\nCorporate Moves: Acquisitions, Partnerships, and Investments\\n\\nNvidia Acquires Gretel (Synthetic Data): In a strategic bid to strengthen its AI development stack, Nvidia acquired San Diego-based startup Gretel AI. Gretel specializes in synthetic data generation – using AI to create realistic datasets for training models when real data is scarce or sensitive. The deal was reportedly a nine-figure acquisition (exceeding $320 million). Nvidia will fold Gretel’s ~80 employees into its ranks and integrate the synthetic data tech into Nvidia’s generative AI cloud services. This marks an important move because as big models guzzle more data, synthetic data is becoming a vital resource to augment real-world data. With major AI players like OpenAI and Anthropic already using synthetic data to expand training sets, Nvidia’s purchase of Gretel positions it to offer data-generation tools alongside its GPUs – effectively stepping closer to a full-stack AI solution (from data to model training to deployment) (Nvidia reportedly acquires synthetic data startup Gretel | TechCrunch).\\nDatabricks & Anthropic Partner for Enterprise AI: A major partnership formed between Databricks (the data analytics platform) and Anthropic (maker of Claude AI). In a five-year landmark deal, Anthropic’s Claude models will be offered natively on the Databricks Data Intelligence platform. Over 10,000 Databricks customers can now access Claude 2 and the latest Claude 3.7 “Sonnet” model directly on their own data in the Databricks environment. The goal is to let enterprises build custom AI agents and chatbots that leverage their proprietary business data, with Claude handling the language understanding and Databricks providing the data and governance layer (Databricks and Anthropic Sign Landmark Deal to Bring Claude Models to the Data Intelligence Platform – Databricks). This tie-up is significant as it marries a top-tier LLM provider with a leading data platform, targeting the demand from companies to apply AI behind their firewalls. It also signals the intensifying competition among cloud and AI firms to lock in enterprise AI workloads through partnerships.\\nGoogle and Nvidia Expand Alliance: Google and NVIDIA – two rivals in some areas – expanded their partnership to collaborate on advancing AI across cloud infrastructure and research domains. Announced during NVIDIA’s GTC, this partnership will involve Google Cloud offering optimized support for NVIDIA‘s hardware (for instance, ensuring Google’s upcoming Gemini models run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs). In return, NVIDIA and Google Cloud will work on joint initiatives in fields like energy, drug discovery, and robotics, combining Google’s AI research (via Google DeepMind) with NVIDIA’s computing prowess. One concrete aspect is that Google Cloud’s Vertex AI will make Gemini models available on NVIDIA hardware with optimized performance (NVIDIA, Alphabet and Google Collaborate on the Future of Agentic …). This collaboration highlights how even the largest AI players find common ground to avoid re-inventing the wheel – Google gains from NVIDIA’s best-in-class AI chips, and NVIDIA gains a major cloud partner deploying its next-gen models. For customers, it should mean better integrated solutions (e.g. using Google’s AI on NVIDIA GPUs with full support), and it may also be aimed at countering the partnership of Microsoft and OpenAI by aligning Google closer with NVIDIA.\\nGoogle’s $32B Acquisition of Wiz (Cloud Security): In one of the biggest tech acquisitions of late, Google confirmed plans to acquire Wiz, a cloud security startup, for a massive $32 billion. While Wiz is not an AI company per se, Google highlighted that integrating Wiz’s platform will allow it to enhance security for Google Cloud customers using AI-driven analysis. Wiz’s tools use AI to detect cloud vulnerabilities and threats in real time. This purchase underscores the trend of cloud providers investing in AI-powered security: by embedding Wiz’s capabilities, Google Cloud aims to offer autonomous security (identifying misconfigurations or breaches using AI) across multi-cloud environments. The deal also signals aggressive spending to maintain cloud leadership – $32B shows Google’s conviction that AI is critical in the cybersecurity fight. For context, this acquisition rivals some of the largest in tech history and shows that despite regulatory scrutiny, the AI gold rush is driving hefty consolidation in related sectors. (Google announces agreement to acquire Wiz)\\nNew AI Ventures and Funding: The past month also saw notable new entrants and funding moves in the AI arena:\\nLarry Page’s AI Startup: Google co-founder Larry Page emerged with a new startup, Dynatomics, focused on applying AI to next-gen manufacturing. The stealthy venture aims to revolutionize factory automation with AI-driven robots and processes. While details are sparse, having a tech pioneer like Page jump back into the fray underscores the attractiveness of AI – even in industries like manufacturing that are ripe for AI-driven transformation (Latest AI Breakthroughs and News: March 2025 | News).\\nInvestments in AI startups continued at a strong pace. For example, Safe Superintelligence Inc. (SSI) – co-founded by former OpenAI scientist Ilya Sutskever – reportedly reached a whopping $32 billion valuation with backing from Alphabet and Nvidia, as it works on cutting-edge “safe AI” research (Why are Alphabet, Nvidia and Google Cloud Investing in SSI?). And Inflection AI (creator of the Pi chatbot) was rumored to be seeking new funding on top of the huge rounds it raised last year. Meanwhile, AI-driven developer platform Replit secured a $1 billion valuation in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz, aiming to build “AI coding assistants” for every programmer. These moves show that venture capital and Big Tech money is still pouring into AI startups, particularly those working on foundation models, AI safety, or enabling technologies – anticipating that the next breakthrough (or competitive edge) could come from these investments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn summary, the last month in AI has been extraordinarily eventful. We’ve seen major model advances (from Google’s Gemini to Meta’s Llama 4, Anthropic’s Claude upgrades, Grok 3’s new API, and the release of OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 models) that push the envelope of what AI can do. We’ve witnessed key product improvements bringing AI further into mainstream apps (search, productivity tools, social media). On the hardware front, competition is heating up with Nvidia’s new chips and rivals like Intel and Cerebras striving to offer alternatives – all to fuel the insatiable demand for AI compute. Finally, corporate maneuvers – big acquisitions, partnerships, and new ventures – underline that the AI industry is in full sprint, with companies spending and collaborating at unprecedented levels to stake their claim in the AI-driven future.\\nOverall, the trajectory of the AI industry remains one of rapid innovation and expansion. With each month bringing more powerful AI models, more integrated AI services, and larger bets by companies, it’s an exciting (and at times overwhelming) era for tech-savvy observers. Stay tuned, as the coming months promise even more significant AI developments on the global stage.\\nTags: AI, Alibaba Qwen, Anthropic, Artificial Intelligence, B2B software, Cerebras, Claude, Databricks, Firebase Studio, Google, Google Gemini, GPT-4.1, Grok, intel, Large Language Models, Llama 4, Meta Llama, Microsoft Copilot, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Software, Tech, Tech News, Technology, Wiz, xAI\\n← Helping Contractors Work Smarter, Get Paid Faster & Cut the Paperwork\\nAI Agents and AI Agent Builders: Must-Know Use Cases and Strategies to Stay Competitive in 2025 →\\nFollow Us\\n\\nTwitter\\nFacebook\\n\\nRecent Posts\\n\\nBuilding a Drone Operations Team: A Comprehensive Guide for Medium to Large Businesses\\nThe No-Fluff Guide to Scaling Your B2B Partner Program in 2025\\nAI is Changing Hiring – And It’s Here to Stay\\nIntegrated AI Strategy & Execution Software: Inspire Software | SourceForge Podcast, episode #49\\nA True Single Pane of Glass Requires a Single Unified Application\\n\\nArchives\\nArchives  \\nCategories\\nCategories \\nSourceForge\\n\\nCreate a Project\\nOpen Source Software\\nBusiness Software\\nTop Downloaded Projects\\nAdd Your Software\\nBusiness Software Advertising\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nAbout\\nTeam\\n\\nSourceForge Headquarters\\n    225 Broadway Suite 1600\\n    San Diego, CA 92101\\n    +1 (858) 454-5900  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResources\\n\\nSupport\\nSite Documentation\\nSite Status\\n\\n\\n© 2025 Slashdot Media.
